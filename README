apt-offline -- An Offline Package Manager 
(C) 2005, 2009 Ritesh Raj Sarraf <rrs@researchut.com> 


apt-offline is an offline package management tool written in the Python Programming Language.
This program, as of now, is intended for people using Debian (And Debian based) systems. 

This program allows leveraging the power of Debian (more precisely apt-get) onto a completely
disconnected machine. Most of the people with slow or no internet connection (most of those in
India/Nepal/Pakistan and nearby countries) have not considered using Debian (or Debian derived
distributions) because Debian's real taste is experienced when it is connected to the internet.

This utility is an attempt in making that problem eradicate. I hope this utility comes to use to you.
I'd be eager to hear your comments/suggestions. Feel free to drop an email at rrs _AT_ researchut |DOT| com
