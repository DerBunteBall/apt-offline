# INTRODUCTION

So you've decided to give this small piece of work a try.
Good ! Let's get it done faster.
pypt-offline is an offline package management tool written
in the Python Programming Language. This program, as of now,
is intended for people using Debian (And Debian based)
systems.


########################################################################
# FOR THE IMPATIENT

 Just follow the following instructions.

 On your home machine (Machine with no/dial-up connection)
# apt-get update
# apt-get -qq --print-uris upgrade > uris

 Copy the uris file on to a floppy/CDRW/USB Stick and take
it to the machine with a high-speed internet connection.

 Run the "pypt-offline" program.
(I hope you'll answer the questions asked correctly.
If not, you're a moron)

 Get the downloaded packages back to the home machine.
and execute the following command:
# apt-get -o dir::cache::archives="/path/to/downloaded/packages" upgrade

# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM

# PROBLEMATIC SITUATION

You have a Debian machine (Laptop/Desktop) at home with
"NO" or dial-up connection only. Still you want to use the
simplicity of "apt-get" to keep your system up-to-date.

You do have a machine with high-speed internet connection
at your friend's place running Microsoft Windows or any other
version of *nix/Linux
[Note: As of this release, Windows support isn't included.
It's in my TODO list.]

The solution is to fetch all the packages required on your
home machine using your friend's "high-speed" machine.
That is where pypt-offline comes into play.


# HOW DOES IT WORK

The program relies heavily on the output provided provided
by the following set of commands:
# apt-get update
(This updates the packages database of our OS)
# apt-get -qq --print-uris upgrade > uris
(This command creates the main file required by pypt-offline
to work)

Once the uris file is created, pypt-offline, on the other
high-speed machine, at your friend's place, downloads the required
packages for the machine with no high-speed internet connection
at home.

Once the packages are downloaded, you can take the downloaded
packages back to the home machine and upgrade it using the following
command:

# cp /some/path/*.deb /tmp
# apt-get -o dir::cache::archives="/tmp/" upgrade

[Note: If you use "apt-listbugs" to track the status of the packages
to be installed, you'll be needed to connect to the net so that
"apt-listbugs" could download the latest BUG STATUS.]
